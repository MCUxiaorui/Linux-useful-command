# Linux command I have used and liked.

## Firstly the common one:

### To send or pull a file from network location.
```
scp --deprecated but works pretty well still.
``` 
usage: scp [file origin] [username]@[address]:[destination]

### To find the WAN IP of current machine.
```
curl ifconfig.me
```
